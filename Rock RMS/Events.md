Hi Casey, 
Registration for this event is set to close on 9/16/2024 but this can be changed if needed.
I am going to provide you with three links:
- The first one is for use in your email and to send out as needed.
- The second one is for you and your team - this link is not to be sent out publicly.
- The third one is for you to review and manage your registrations.
First, the event registration link - https://npmi.org/event-registration/hm-gs-team-night-2024
This is the link you will use to invite people to the event. Please do not use this link to test registering yourself or any other staff members. Doing so will cause a duplicate person in Rock.
Second, the link to use for testing. We do encourage you to test so that you will receive the confirmation email. Please test using https://rock.northpointministries.net/event-registration/hm-gs-team-night-2024 and use your real name and information. You can go back to remove your test registration after the fact if you'd like. Please make sure to use your real information to complete your test, as this data goes directly into Rock.
Third, the link to view your registrations - https://rock.northpointministries.net/RegistrationInstance/93. This is where you'll see who has registered (and by whom). Please DO NOT make any updates/changes to the Payments, Fees, Discounts, or Linkages tabs. The "Registrants" tab contains a list of everyone's responses to the questions. 😊
Thanks for partnering with us on this event!
