# Flexbox Overview

**Flexbox** (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model that allows you to design a responsive and efficient layout structure.

## Key Points

- **Default Direction:**

  - The default direction for flex items is `row`.
  - Flex items are placed in a row by default, with the ability to adjust their direction and alignment.

- **Grid in Dev Tools:**

  - If you see a grid in your browser's developer tools, it likely means that Flexbox is being used.
  - This grid helps visualize how items are aligned and distributed within a flex container.

- **Responsive Layouts:**

  - Flexbox simplifies the creation of responsive layouts.
  - It allows for easy positioning, alignment, and distribution of space among items within a container.
  - With Flexbox, you can ensure that your layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

- **Streamlined Layout Process:**
  - Flexbox streamlines the process of creating complex layouts.
  - It offers properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction` to control the alignment and distribution of space among items.
- **Part of the Display Property:**
  - Flexbox is a value of the `display` property.
  - Setting `display: flex;` on a container enables Flexbox, allowing you to use its properties on the children of that container.

## Example Usage

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```
